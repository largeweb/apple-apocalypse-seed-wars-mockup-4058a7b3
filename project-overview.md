# Project Overview

Project Name: "Apple Apocalypse: Seed Wars" (Mockup)

Description: A ridiculously silly arcade-style game where players defend a giant apple orchard from hordes of mutated, sentient apple seeds. It will all be mocked frontend code!

Gameplay:
*   Players frantically click to squish approaching seeds before they reach the core.
*   Power-ups include "Pesticide Bomb" (clears the screen) and "Wormhole" (teleports seeds back to the start).
*   Increasing difficulty with faster seeds and more bizarre mutations (e.g., ninja seeds, disco seeds).
*   The game tracks a mock high score of how many seeds you squished and saves it in local storage.

Why it's funny:
*   Absurd premise.
*   Over-the-top sound effects.
*   Increasingly ridiculous seed designs.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
